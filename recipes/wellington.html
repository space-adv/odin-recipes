 <p> Beef Wellington, beef fillet coated in chopped mushrooms and liver pâté and 
    baked inside a puff pastry shell. Considerable confusion surrounds 
    the origin of beef Wellington. One version that seems more legend 
    than fact attributes it to a cook for the famed duke of Wellington (Arthur Wellesley), the English general who defeated 
    the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. 
    Wellington, it is said, liked food that could be eaten on the march, 
    and the dish, with its crusty shell, is certainly portable.
    Another origin story has the dish simply named in Wellington’s honour,
    while yet another posits that the beef roast wrapped in pastryresembled a Wellington boot—
    the original leather kind, not the rubber boot beloved of gardeners today.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 400g beef fillets</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
        <li>500g mixture of wild mushrooms, cleaned</li>
        <li>1 thyme sprig, leaves only</li>
        <li>500g puff pastry</li>
        <li>8 slices of Parma ham</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Method</h1>
    <p>Serves 4</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling
            film to set its shape, then chill overnight.</li>

        <li>Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a
            hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until 
            browned all over and rare in the middle. </li>

        <li>Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, 
            the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, 
            continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes 
            until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste 
            (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.</li>

        <li>Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece 
            into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. 
            Chill in the refrigerator.</li>

        <li>Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, 
            overlapping them slightly, to create a square. 
            Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.</li>

        <li>Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham.
            Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film
            to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet,
            then chill for at least 30 minutes.</li> 

        <li>Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef,
            hen wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash.
            Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly
            and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes
            until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
            
        <li>Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with a sauce of your preference.</li>                               
         
    </ol>
