    <h1>Brownies are chocolaty baked products made in square or rectangle shapes. 
        They are commonly consumed around the world</h1>

        <p>  A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. 
            Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending 
            on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their 
            upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, chocolate chips, or other 
            ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate 
            in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in t
            he United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the 
            first half of the 20th century.</p>
        
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>For 9 servings</p>

        <ul>
            <li>8 oz good-quality chocolate(225 g), semi-sweet</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups sugar(250 g)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour(95 g)</li>
            <li>¼ cup cocoa powder(30 g)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h1>Preparation</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 
                Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
            
            <li>Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate 
                in the microwave in 20-second intervals, 
                saving the other half for later.</li>   
                
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in 
                the eggs and vanilla for 1-2 minutes, until the mixture becomes 
                fluffy and light in color.</li>    

            <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook),
                 then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. 
                 Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix as t
                 his will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture.</li>   
                 
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter 
                to the prepared baking dish.</li>     

            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your 
                brownies, then cool completely.</li>    

            <li>Slice and enjoy</li>
